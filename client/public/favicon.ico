The contents of the file /amogus-website/amogus-website/client/public/favicon.ico will be a binary file representing the favicon. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file should contain the favicon data.

<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. Please replace it with the actual favicon data. -->
